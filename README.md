<h2 align="center">Get Statistics On US States And Cities</h2>

### Introduction

CityStats is a minimal API for accessing data on all 50 US States and the top 330 most populous US Cities. Publicly available to all, CityStats aims to provide up to date data and statistics in a programmatically-accessible format that can be utilized and integrated into educational and research projects.

Aggregating and integrating data from multiple local government websites as well as publicly available resources like [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org), CityStats provides it's user with a simple API with which to interface using their programming language of choice.
CityStats is a simple Read Only REST API that delivers statistics about all 50 states
within the United States of America as well as the top 330 most populated cities
within the United States.

#### Why CityStats?

CityStats was made so that programmers and students could easily acquire and
parse publicly available data on US states and cities. While there are many
online resources for acquiring this data, the creator of CityStats, [Brian Hayes](https://brianhayes.dev), desired to have an interface that could quickly grab this data.

#### Getting Started

:memo: Official Online Documentation can on the basics can be found at the
[Official CityStats Info Website](https://citystats.info). While not all use
cases are covered, CityStats (as mentioned earlier) is very minimal and is very
easy to understand.

**Basic Queries**

For example if you wish to grab all information available on the state of
Alabama, one could simply visit `https://citystats.xyz/states/1` or `https://citystats.xyz/states/Alabama`. Grabbing this data via the standard `curl` command is straight-forward:

```bash
curl "https://citystats.xyz/states/1" -H "Accept: application/json" | jq
```

This will return the following JSON:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "state_name": "Alabama",
        "state_abbreviation": "AL",

                },
                {
                    "senator_name": "Katie Britt",
                    "img_url": "https://www.citystats.xyz/images/states/1/senators/2"
                }
            ],
            "house_delegates": [
                {
                    "delegate_name": "Jerry Carl",
                    "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/delegates/1"
                },
                {
                    "delegate_name": "Barry Moore",
                    "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/delegates/2"
                },
                {
                    "delegate_name": "Mike Rogers",
                    "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/delegates/3"
                },
                {
                    "delegate_name": "Robert Aderholt",
                    "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/delegates/4"
                },
                {
                    "delegate_name": "Dale Strong",
                    "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/delegates/5"
                },
                {
                    "delegate_name": "Gary Palmer",
                    "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/delegates/6"
                },
                {
                    "delegate_name": "Terri Sewell",
                    "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/delegates/7"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
]
```

**Query By Field**

One can also grab more specified data about each particular state or city, like it's
government or total area. Take this code snippet in python for example, that
grabs all the government data on Alabama:

```python
import requests
import json

url = https://citystats.xyz/states/1/government
headers = {"Accept": "application/json}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    formatted_data = json.dumps(data, indent=4)
    print(formatted_data)
else:
    print("Failed to fetch data:", response.status_code)
```

Invoking such a Python script would return the following JSON:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "state_name": "Alabama",
        "state_abbreviation": "AL",
        "government": {
            "governor": {
                "governor_name": "Kay Ivey",
                "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/governor"
            },
            "senators": [
                {
                    "senator_name": "Tommy Tuberville",
                    "img_url": "https://www.citystats.xyz/images/states/1/senators/1"
                },
                {
                    "senator_name": "Katie Britt",
                    "img_url": "https://www.citystats.xyz/images/states/1/senators/2"
                }
            ],
            "house_delegates": [
                {
                    "delegate_name": "Jerry Carl",
                    "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/delegates/1"
                },
                {
                    "delegate_name": "Barry Moore",
                    "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/delegates/2"
                },
                {
                    "delegate_name": "Mike Rogers",
                    "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/delegates/3"
                },
                {
                    "delegate_name": "Robert Aderholt",
                    "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/delegates/4"
                },
                {
                    "delegate_name": "Dale Strong",
                    "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/delegates/5"
                },
                {
                    "delegate_name": "Gary Palmer",
                    "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/delegates/6"
                },
                {
                    "delegate_name": "Terri Sewell",
                    "img_url": "https://citystats.xyz/images/states/1/delegates/7"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
]
```

**Query By SubField**

We can get even more specific data by tacking on another subfield to our query.
This time, we'll utilize NodeJS to grab all of Alabama's senators:

```javascript
const https = require('https')
const util = require('util')

const options = {
    hostname: 'citystats.xyz',
    path: '/states/1/government/senators',
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        Accept: 'application/json',
    },
}

const req = https.request(options, res => {
    let data = ''

    res.on('data', chunk => {
        data += chunk
    })

    res.on('end', () => {
        try {
            const jsonData = JSON.parse(data)
            console.log(util.inspect(jsonData, { colors: true, depth: null }))
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error parsing JSON:', error.message)
        }
    })
})

req.on('error', error => {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error.message)
})

req.end()
```

Running this script will give us the following JSON:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "state_name": "Alabama",
        "state_abbreviation": "AL",
        "government": {
            "senators": [
                {
                    "senator_name": "Tommy Tuberville",
                    "img_url": "https://www.citystats.xyz/images/states/1/senators/1"
                },
                {
                    "senator_name": "Katie Britt",
                    "img_url": "https://www.citystats.xyz/images/states/1/senators/2"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
]
```

**Query By Id**

Additionally, if we wish only to grab one specific senator, we can do so by
appending their specific index/id number to the end of the url like so:

```bash
curl "https://citystats.xyz/states/1/government/senators/1" -H "Accept: application/json" | jq
```

Which, of course, yields us the following JSON output:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "state_name": "Alabama",
        "state_abbreviation": "AL",
        "government": {
            "senator": {
                "senator_name": "Tommy Tuberville",
                "img_url": "https://www.citystats.xyz/images/states/1/senators/1"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

**Images**

CityStats Also hosts images for government officials such as senators, house
delegates, mayor, city council members, etc. Each of these can be found at the
/images subdirectory of the `citystats.xyz` domain, followed by either `states` or
`cities` subdirectory, as well as their ids, etc. Once you find a specific
`img_url` field within the API, utilizing tools like `wget`, `curl`, or simply
downloading the image directly from your browser will download the image. Please
note that not all images are available for certain government officials,
indicated by their `img_url` field having a `null` value.
